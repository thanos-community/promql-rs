//! The evals the engine is expected to pass, and must never stop passing.
//!
//! Most of the corpus is out of reach today, so a green CI run cannot
//! mean "everything passes". It means "everything we have *declared*
//! supported still passes" — and this is that declaration.
//!
//! It is deliberately an allowlist rather than a record of what fails.
//! Both catch a regression, but only one answers the question a reader
//! actually has, which is *what works right now*. A denylist answers it
//! by omission: the supported set is the complement of a file listing
//! everything broken, written down nowhere. It also makes deleting
//! coverage invisible — a case that quietly stops being tested looks
//! like any other line. Here it is a deletion in the diff.
//!
//! # Three checks, all failing closed
//!
//! | | |
//! |---|---|
//! | listed, and passes | fine |
//! | listed, and does not pass | **fail** — the regression this exists to catch |
//! | passes, not listed | **fail** — something was implemented; declare it |
//! | listed, no such eval ran | **fail** — an upstream re-pin moved it |
//!
//! The third is the ratchet. Implementing a feature *is* the act of
//! declaring it supported, so the list cannot drift behind reality and
//! nobody has to remember to update it. It costs a drive-by contributor
//! one re-bless, and their diff shows the win.
//!
//! # Form
//!
//! Grouped by `.test` file. A file is either the string `"all"` or a
//! list of case ids:
//!
//! ```toml
//! staleness = "all"
//! aggregators = [ 'sum by (group) (http_requests) @ 3000000' ]
//! ```
//!
//! `"all"` is stronger than spelling out the file's current cases: it
//! also binds evals a future re-pin *adds* to that file. That is the
//! point of it — an area that is fully green should stay fully green,
//! including for tests that do not exist yet.
//!
//! Case ids are the query text and the evaluation time, never the line
//! number. Upstream reflows comments constantly, and a line-keyed file
//! would invalidate wholesale on every bump and teach everyone to bless
//! without reading.
