/// parsed, which is what a real engine gets. Turning a
/// [`SeriesDescription`] into timestamped samples is the storage layer's
/// job, not the harness's.
///
/// # Contract
///
/// The oracle configures Prometheus a particular way, and an
/// implementation has to match it or diverge for reasons that have
/// nothing to do with being wrong. From `scripts/promql-oracle`:
///
/// - **Sample timestamps.** Value `i` of a series sits at
///   `i * interval_secs * 1000` ms, counting from 0 — upstream's
///   `testStartTime` is the Unix epoch. An omitted value (`_`) emits no
///   sample at all, and `stale` emits `StaleNaN`
///   (`0x7ff0000000000002`). Note `1+1x40` is 41 points, not 40; see
///   `promql-parser/tests/series_desc.rs`.
/// - **Lookback delta 5m**, Prometheus's default.
/// - **`@` modifier and negative offsets enabled.** 32 and 8 corpus
///   cases respectively need them.
/// - **Experimental functions enabled**, matching what
///   `testcases_test.go` sets before parsing corpus queries.
/// - **`MaxSamples` effectively unlimited** (1e10), so no case should
///   fail on a sample limit.
/// - **Default subquery step 1m**, but unobservable: the corpus contains
///   no stepless subquery, so this cannot be exercised.
/// - **A range query always yields a matrix.** The other
///   [`QueryResult`] variants exist for completeness, not because a
///   range query produces them.
/// - **Error text is not compared**, only the fact of erroring; 11
///   corpus cases legitimately error.
///
/// # Async

/// This trait is synchronous because the harness is: `libtest-mimic`

/// `range_query` rather than the trait becoming async and forcing every
