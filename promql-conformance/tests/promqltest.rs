//! Prometheus's promqltest corpus, replayed against the Rust engine.
//!
//! 2,098 evals across 20 vendored `.test` files, each carrying its own
//! expected values. Unlike [the differential suite](differential.rs)
//! there is nothing to ask at runtime — no oracle, no Go, no network —
//! so this is the conformance suite that actually runs in CI.
//!
//! # What green means
//!
//! Everything named in `testdata/prometheus/SUPPORTED.toml` still
//! passes. That file is the list of what this engine is expected to do
//! *right now*, and nothing on it may ever stop working.
//!
//! It is an allowlist, so the rest of the corpus runs without gating
//! anything. Three things turn CI red: a listed eval stops passing, an
//! unlisted eval starts passing (declare it), or a listed eval stops
//! existing after an upstream re-pin.
//!
//! # Seeing where we stand
//!
//! Just run it. The per-file scoreboard and the missing-feature table
//! print on every run, gated or not — a green tick never hides how much
//! of PromQL is left.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test -p promql-conformance --test promqltest
//!
//! # every eval as its own trial, failing as it really is
//! PROMQL_PROMQLTEST_ALL=1 cargo test -p promql-conformance --test promqltest
//!
//! # ...narrowed to one file, or one feature you are implementing
//! PROMQL_PROMQLTEST_ALL=1 cargo test -p promql-conformance --test promqltest -- operators/
//! PROMQL_PROMQLTEST_ALL=1 cargo test -p promql-conformance --test promqltest -- topk
//! ```
//!
//! `PROMQL_PROMQLTEST_BLESS=1` rewrites `SUPPORTED.toml` and
//! `UNSUPPORTED.md` from what actually passes.
//!
//! # What is not asserted
//!
//! `expect warn` / `info` / `no_warn` / `no_info` — 555 evals — need an
//! annotation channel the engine does not have. They are parsed, counted
//! and reported, but not checked; the count is printed so the gap stays
//! visible rather than silently passing.
