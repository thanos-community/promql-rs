//! A global allocator that counts live heap bytes and their high-water
//! mark, for the memory bench.
//!
//! It counts the sizes callers asked for, not what the allocator behind it
//! rounds them up to, so the numbers are the same over the system
//! allocator and over jemalloc and compare across machines. Relaxed
//! atomics are enough: the peak may miss a transient overlap of two
//! threads by one allocation, which is noise at the sizes measured.
